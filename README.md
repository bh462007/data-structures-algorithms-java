# Data Structures & Algorithms in Java

This repository contains structured implementations of core Data Structures and Algorithms using Java.

The focus is on writing clean, readable code while understanding time and space complexity for each problem.

## Topics Covered

### Java Fundamentals
- Variables and Data Types
- Control Flow
- Methods
- Basic Object-Oriented Concepts

### Arrays
- Traversal
- Searching
- Common array problem patterns
- Time and space complexity analysis

### Strings
- Character manipulation
- Pattern-based problems
- String traversal techniques

### Searching Algorithms
- Linear Search
- Binary Search
- Complexity comparison (O(n) vs O(log n))

### Sorting Algorithms
- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Internal working and complexity analysis

### Recursion
- Base case design
- Recursive thinking patterns
- Stack behavior and memory flow

## Approach

- Write logic before implementation
- Analyze time and space complexity
- Focus on clarity over cleverness
- Organize solutions topic-wise

---

## Goal

Develop strong problem-solving ability and build a solid foundation for technical interviews and backend development.
